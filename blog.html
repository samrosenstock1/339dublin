        <h3>Guinness Factory: A tour & tasting experience.</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
        <p>Today I went to the Guinnnes Factory and learned many interesting facts. Guinness is made from only 4 ingrediants: water, barley, hops, and yeast. Guinness gets its dark color by being roasted to 232 degrees celcius.
            Guinness is only made in Dublin, and the reason it does not taste as good in other countries is not due to the traveling. Actually, Guinness travels really well, but once the Keg is opened - then it does not last as long.
            Therefore, the reason Ireland has the best Guinness is because people drink it more here, so each Keg is used in a quicker period of time - making the Guinness better. There are also more fun facts such as:
            Guinness is supposed to be at 5-7 degrees celcius, the tube from the Keg to where it is poured should be at least 6 feet long, and there are many more!'</p>

        <h3>Exploring Dublin: A City of History and Culture</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-07">May 7, 2024</time>
        <p>Today I saw many things, ranging from the most infamous murder of all of Europe to the best Guinness in Ireland! I started off the day with an amazing brunch. Next, I took a tour of the city
            from a tour guide who had so much information in his back pocket. I learned about the city's culture and history leading up to current day, and learned about the story behind the Spire of Dublin. Afterwards, I drank my first Irish Guinness 
            at Lord Edwards and was very impressed. I finished off the night with a great Chinese Restaurant.</p>
